# Installation

## Ansible

You're going to need Ansible on your own machine. Don't install it on the
server.

See [the official
docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-node-requirements)
on how to install it.

On Arch, this is:

```sh
$ pacman -S ansible
```

## LittleLab

Clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mstcl/littlelab
```
